## ODIN-RECIPES ##

This project is an assignment inside the "Foundations" course from The Odin Project.

It consists of a simple website with a main "hub" page and a couple pages, each showing a recipe (Description, ingredients, steps and an image) all made in pure html.


This project will put my html knowledge into practice: From links and images to different kinds of text and lists, hopefully demonstrating these skills in the process.
